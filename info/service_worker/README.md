# About The *service-worker.js* File

Service workers are Javascript code that operate between your web application and any server that it connects to. They're sort of like middleware that runs on the client side.

Service workers basically act as a bridge between your client-side code and any calls it makes to the server. In the case of PWAs, the service worker is always checking to see whether the Internet connection is working whenever a call to the server is made.
